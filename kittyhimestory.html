      <div class="story">
  <p style="float: left;">an angel boy came down from the heavens to admire the earth below.
when he came down and explored the world for the first time in a while, he met a girl, pure and sweet. over time, they went from friends, to close friends,
to soulmates. he fell in love with her purity, and she, his caringness and determination. their love
spiraled into an emotion so strong, it's gentle passion gifted them with a child, whom had the soaring 
beauty, wings, and power of her father, and the politeness, kindness, and softness of her mother. brighter
than the shining moon on the night she was birthed, her mother blessed upon her a name suited to a princess
from the moon- etoile, unaware that she was indeed a child of the moon. however, when etoile was just a few years old, the devils tracked down her magical aura
and went in pursuit of her mother, killing her in the process. around this time, etoile's father was tending to 
his duties in heaven, unaware of the incident. etoile remained an orphan and was found and raised by zephyr. zephyr taught etoile
how to be a lovable, sweet and wonderful lady, and etoile for sure saw zephyr as the best mother figure
she had after her real parents. but eventually, even zephyr was gone, and etoile was left feeling empty.
having no one to turn to anymore, she spent her days in soltitude. yearning for somebody to come and take her
away from this misery... just then, selene, a dragon whom is feared and acknowledged as the personification
of the moon, told etoile that she was destined to be with her. selene was strict, and etoile found her 
intimidating and serious at times. but in truth, selene was just another good mother figure to her. etoile now works
as a lunarian, delivering selene's messages and claiming it to be 'truth', as well as living with her fellow
lunarian friends.</p>
